The QR-Based Food Ordering System project is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.
The aim of this project was to create an efficient and user-friendly system for food ordering in restaurants, cafes, and similar establishments. 
By leveraging QR codes and modern web technologies, the project simplified the ordering process, enhanced customer experience, and optimized operational efficiency.
